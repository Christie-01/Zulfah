    <h1>WATER</h1>
    <p>
        Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. 
        It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, 
        and it is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere 
        and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent ).

        Lake waters contribute a small percentage of water in the hydrosphere 
        but it is an important source of freshwater. The lake and stream waters are used for household purposes,
         agricultural purposes and also for industrial purposes.
